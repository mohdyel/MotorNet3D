This AI program, located in the current folder, is designed to generate a .pth file that encapsulates the trained modelâ€”including its encoder and learned parameters. In addition, essential components such as the codebook (encoder) and hyperparameters are stored in Python .pkl files.
The primary purpose of the model is to detect and count the number of bacterial motors present in a single 3D tomogram.
